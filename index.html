            <h1>Pizarro</h1>
            <p>The conquistador Pizarro that invaded the Inca empire in 1533 was actually four brothers: Fransisco Pizarro, Gonzalo Pizarro, Hernando Pizarro and Juan Pizarro although Fransisco is the most famous.</p>
<p>The reason Pizarro, with 168 soldiers, could conquer one of the largest and most well organised empires on earth at the time, is the diseases they brought.<br />
The Spaniards first brought smallpox caused by a virus that killed 30-50% of the population.<br />
After that, another virus disease, measles, killed 25-30% of those left. When a third epidemic with both smallpox and measles broke out at the same time another 30-60% died. Collectively these diseases killed 95% of the pre-Pizarro population in the Andes.<br />
The first smallpox outbreak notably killed the Inca Emperor, <em>Huyana Capac</em> and his heir <em>Ninan Cuyochic</em> sending the Inca empire into a civil war that the Spaniards exploited.</p>
<p>How come then that the Incas died of European viruses but the Europeans didn’t die of Inca viruses? Wasn’t there an Americapox that the Europeans wasn’t immune to?<br />
The short answer is no.<br />
Measles, for example, developed from cattle and spread to humans. Transmission of viruses between species are extremely rare but European densely populated cities with people living close to animals gave a lot of opportunities. It’s easy to win the lottery if you buy billions of tickets. In South America people did not domesticate animals (since there were no big useful animals to domesticate except llamas) so they did not live close to animals and hence no viruses transmitted from animals. So when the europeans brought smallpox, influenza, typhus, diphtheria, chicken pox and measles the Incas didn’t bring any horrific disease.</p>
